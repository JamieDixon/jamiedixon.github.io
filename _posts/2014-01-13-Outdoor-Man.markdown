I've always admired the idea of being an ourdoor man.

The man who, come the weekend, has planned, organised and is about to execute, a master plan of outdoor persuit and provility.

He's the kind of guy who builds his own home furnature and can light a fire using an ice cube.

There have been times that I've felt like that man. My four month excursion around New Zealand for instance, living in a van for a large portion of the time, eschewing footware to the glory of the hardened foot and finding sand between my toes when there hasn't been a beach around for days.

But for the most part, that man is a long way away.

I like the idea of being that man, but there's something else in my life, another force of equal or greater strength that holds back this force of manliness and leads to writing articles for the internet instead.

It's that sense that, whilst there's great adventure and trial out in the world, there's great adventure and trial out in the world.

Those moment between waking up and getting out of bed. Those few seconds of pure peace and delight. And being able to hold onto that and sustain it for five, ten, one hundred and eighty minutes on a Sunday morning, makes the very idea of even leaving the house seem like a story from a galaxy far far away.

I love the idea of that outdoor man, but I also love the indoors.

Out doors is filled with mountains and rivers and gullys and treasure and pirates (It's been a while since I've trully ventured out into the wild), but the indoors has so much to offer too.

There's my PC and my guitar, the countless books to be read and an unlimited number of computer games to be played. Where outdoors can I run amock a city of disenfranchised aliens whilst being able to jump higher than the talled skyscraper and run faster that the slickest of sports cars.

There's the kettle, the sofa, the TV, the PC, the iPad, the internet. Reading, watching, surfing, learning, writing, singing, dancing, lying on the floor watching the ceiling, lying on the sofa with my head on the foor watching the TV upside down. So many of the things I enjoy about life and inside my house.

But somewhere benath all of this joy and wonderment there's a dull, dark feeling. An ache that pours itself into the mental chatter of an imagined society which whom my own personal experience is more psychological than physics.

The undertone to the current of life that says a man should be outdoors, doing outdoors men's things.

And I'm sure and convinced that the feeling is right, that I should pack up my canoo, strap it to the top of my Land Rover and head for the hills. I'm sure my girlfriend would love a bit of adventure, the fresh air, the rush of blood pumping through our veins.

But the games, the guitar, the algorithm I didn't get chance on Friday afternoon to look into. The Javascript framework that would probably look good on my CV. And what is a message bus anyway? I need to know!

I used to live with a guy who's an outdoor man. Every weekend the offer of a new adventure would arise and so would any excuse to close the blinds and stay inside to learn just a little bit more.

It's funny how we create the idea of who the right kind of us should be and then hold ourselves up against our own imagined sense of self. What's more, the us that we hold up against our idealised image is yet another self created entity, evoked from the depths of our subconscious and projected onto the wall with comparative license.

When ever I ask "Who am I?" and "What am I hear for", I'm aware that what comes out is created by me. It's a ficticious character in the ongoing play of life. Sometimes a villan, sometimes a hero.

I'm quite sure that there are few, if any, people who trully think I should get out into the mountains but I do know it's what I think about myself...sometimes.

Perhaps this summer will be filled with more outdoor activities or perhaps I'll find a new challenge that I'll enjoy indoors.

Whether the outdoor man or the indoor man, I know they're both carefully crafted projected perceptions, not me.
