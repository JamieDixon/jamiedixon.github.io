Another day, another blog.

It's been a number of years since i've put "pen to paper" to write anything that mattered to me personally.

My tech blog over at http://jamie-dixon.co.uk has never felt like the right place to veer into the casms of my thinking and jot down all those things that seem of importance at the itme.

Likewise, my old blog at http://warmthonthesoul.com is reminiscent of my days studying NLP and hypnosis, and on both accounts those websites have be utilised for professional purposes.

Offthescript is just about expression. Ideas, loves, loathes, music, relationships and life.

There have been countless times that a piece of music has moved me to tears and the desire to put words to that has been overwhelming. Likewise, my recently studies of systems like the Enneagram have left me wanting to explore aspects of myself through the medium of writing, mainly so that I'll remember the bursting banks of ideas that often fall pray to forgetfullness.

To complement the above there's also the point about being able to write. I'd like to be able to write well and I'm sure that writing regularly with a certain amount of accountability (That'll be you, dear reader), will spur me on to learn how to write and express ideas in something other than a torrent of barely comprehensible spaggetti.

The plan, then, is to start writing on my journey to work. I spend an hour a day on the train and usually occupy that time with reading or playing sudoku (a word I can't actually say correctly most of the time).
I'm currently half way through Pratchett's Lords and Ladies and planning to complete his Discworld series before realising I was always a character, not an observer as I initially thought, so I'll still keep up the reading.

The laptop that I've been using for the past 4 years ia almost at its end however, as luck should have it, I recently bought a MacBook from a friend. It seems like the right thing for a budding writer to do, sitting on a train with a Mac of some kind, whimsically annotating the goings on of an imagined landscape.

And there we have it. A new year, a new blog, and a new first post. While I sit here curious as to whether the person sat behind me is reading everything I write, I'll also start to consider which blogging platform I'm going to use.

See you on the other side.
