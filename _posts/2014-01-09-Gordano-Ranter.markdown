Sometimes an experience can take hold of you, sweep you through the ticks of time, and leave you with an indescribable sense that everything is good in the world.

For me, music is one of those powerful forces that takes hold and transports me into new worlds of delight and fear and joy and pain. It's almost impossble to describe the sensations that are at the tip of the iceberg of experience that is music, however, impossiblity has never been one to stop me before and so, I shall at least try.

The Gordano Ranter is a tune by Jamie Smith's Mabon, A Welsh Folk quinted that I first saw in 2013 at the Cambridge Folk festival.
They were the first act that I saw and, as it turned out, they were the most powerfully moving musicians I had the pleasure of experiencing.

It can be hard to describe an indescribable experience so bare with me and I'll do my best to take you through this tune. I sugest you listen to the piece before reading my description here and I'm certain you experience will vary. It's usually best to have your own before diving into someone elses.

###Stop for a moment and imagine this

It's dark, really dark. The kind of dark that only those who've never seen the light could understand. The kind of dark that exists before the dawn of the universe. Which is apt because that's where our journey begins, right back at the start of the universe.

Floating in the void that is nothingness, no matter, no time, no music. Just the gentle stillness of flow that exists without movement. Somewhere in all of this emptyness there's a vibration. Deep and menacing. The kind of rumble you might feel from an earthquake that just happened a thousand miles away and is almost unnoticable. It's a vibration and it's all encompsing. In this blank piece of existence the warm glow of this bass line is everything.

An idea forms and bounces around inside the deep vacuous space of this newly created pocket of bass. It's slow and confused as it swims around the gassy essence of this pre-labour universe in the throws of its own creation.

In a moment, our bubble of a universe discoveres it's ability to expand and distance becomes everywhere. And in the farthest portion of our distance a golden fleck of thread unwinds into the birthing canal of time. A single golden thread of music that winds it's way ever closer. Dancing, twisting, exploring. A moment of self discovery as it winds back on itself, through itself, under, over, around. It's falling in love with it's own ability to be. An urge arrises, a desire, an idea of potential and self-realisation. And in a moment of pure extacy, an explosion.

The whole of space and time is filled with falling leaves of golden music that reach every corner of an infinate galaxy of possiblity. Riding the notes of time with only the desire to be expressed. Each sound complementing the next in an on going song of harmony and oneness. Each sound, each vibration a portion of the greater song through which all things are created.

And then silence. The kind of silence that can only exist in a noisy room. The inescapable sound of a silence so thick that it begins to become the backdrop to a new world. A world filled with such melody that can take the listner on a flying capet journey of discovery.

That's my experience of the first 60 seconds of the Gordano Ranter. A piece that moved me from the moment I first heard it at the Cambridge Folk Festival. A trully brilliant golden thread of music and one mans narative.
